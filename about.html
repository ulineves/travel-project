I've been living in Denver, CO since 2016 and love it here! However... I do miss my home state a lot, so I had an idea! What if I can help other people learn more about Maranhão and hopefully get them to go there? That way I can help you folks figure out your trips while feeling a little more connected to home. </p>
                    <p class="about-us">The other human in this picture is <a class="links" href="#">Dean</a>, the american half of the relationship. We met through Tinder (yup, it works, guys), tied the knot after 6 months together and have been happily married since then. As a back-end web developer, Dean got me in this computer world, which was the start point in my digital content producing life. In December of 2017, we went together to Maranhão for the first time for a whole month, and Dean fell in love with it. Since then, our goal is to show as many people as we can about what <s>my</s> our state has to offer. Maranhão is such an amazing place to visit with so much to see, but we feel like there is not a lot of information out there for travelers, specially the ones not from Brazil. We truly hope we can add valuable information to your notes and hopefully you can have an amazing experience there.</p>
